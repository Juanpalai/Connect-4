# Connect Four

This is a Connect Four game developed entirely in Java using the Swing graphics library. The game features a simple yet challenging AI. Although the program was developed in Colombia and is in Spanish, it is intuitive and can be played even if you don't understand the language. Test your board game skills and challenge my work!
